        Taken in the mount's bucketing zone rather than the host's: the two

        one shifts the whole listing by a day around either midnight.

        A method rather than a module-level call so a test can pin it and so
        a long-lived mount does not freeze its window at import time.

            tz (str): the mount-wide bucketing zone.
