    The one field whose two callers disagree about more than a name. A
    builtin publishes ``range_read(accessor, path, start, end)`` with the
    end exclusive, while the table slot is ``(accessor, path, index,
    offset, size)``, and ``BaseVFS.__getattr__`` binds only the
    accessor. Forwarded raw, the table function took ``start`` as its
    index and ``end`` as its offset, so an object-store table read from
    ``end`` to EOF instead of the window asked for, and one that touched
    the index at all crashed on an int.

    The index is read per call rather than captured, because
    ``set_index`` can replace the store after construction.
