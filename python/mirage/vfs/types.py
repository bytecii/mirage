# Per-slot op shapes, the twins of types.ts's ReaddirOp/StatOp/...
# generics. The accessor parameter stays Any on purpose: every backend
# annotates its own concrete accessor, and a `accessor: Accessor`
# protocol parameter would reject all of them under contravariance
# (TS solves this with `<A extends Accessor>`; a generic frozen
# dataclass plus functools.partial makes that plumbing cost more here
# than the accessor check is worth — the slot SHAPE is the guard that
# stops readdir being wired where stat belongs). The leading two
# parameters are positional-only because backends name the path
# parameter both `path` and `path_spec`.
