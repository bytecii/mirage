    what keeps subscript semantics out of the evaluator: whether the
    subscript text is an arithmetic expression (indexed) or a literal
    key (associative) is the variable's to answer, and only the session
    knows the variable.

            key for one reference: the evaluated index for an indexed

            one. The mapping is the evaluator's current view, pending
            assignments included, so ``i=2, a[i]`` reads the new ``i``.
