    You start the machine yourself; mirage only connects to it and
    execs lines. The smolvm CLI is the transport, so there is no SDK
    dependency and no daemon socket wiring; each line is one `smolvm
    machine exec` with the merged environment, the rebased cwd, real
    stdin, and separated stderr.

    Unlike a container, the guest runs its own kernel, so the line
    sees that kernel's filesystem and nothing of the host's except
    what the machine was given at boot (`--volume`). Serve the
    workspace inside the guest at the host's mount prefixes, the same
    contract every provider in this family carries.
