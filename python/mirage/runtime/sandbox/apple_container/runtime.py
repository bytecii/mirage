    """Containers under Apple's `container` tool as a whole-line runtime.

    You start the containers yourself; mirage only connects to them and
    execs lines. The `container` CLI is the transport, so there is no
    SDK dependency and no XPC wiring; each line is one `container exec`
    with the merged environment, the session cwd, real stdin, and
    separated stderr.

    Each container is its own lightweight VM with its own Linux
    kernel, so, as in a smolvm guest, the line sees nothing of the
    host's filesystem except what the container was given at start
    (`--volume`). Serve the workspace inside it at the host's mount
    prefixes, the same contract every provider in this family carries.
    The image needs a POSIX sh, which every argv runs under (PRELUDE).

    A line runs in its session's container (config ``containers``,
    else ``container``), so one runtime can give every agent a VM of
    its own. Each container is probed once, on its first line.

    Args:
        captures (Sequence[str] | None): commands routed to this runtime.
        config (SandboxConfig | dict[str, Any] | None): container settings.
        script (Callable[..., Any] | ScriptSource | None): execution hook.
