    """The line dressed to run on the remote host: cwd, env, then sh.

    SSH exec has no docker-style ``-w``/``-e`` (the protocol's env
    channel is AcceptEnv-gated server-side, so it silently drops
    names), so the working directory and the merged environment ride
    the command itself: ``cd 'cwd' && env 'K=V' ... sh -c 'line'``.
    Every piece is sh_single_quoted, so the remote login shell reads
    each as one word whatever it holds; the machine only needs a
    POSIX-compatible shell.

    Args:
        line (str): the raw shell line.
        env (dict[str, str]): the merged environment.
        cwd (str): the working directory, passed through verbatim.
