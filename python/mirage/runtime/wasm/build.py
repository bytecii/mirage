    A wasm guest is a whole interpreter, so `python.wasm` needs its
    stdlib somewhere it can read. This is that half of the guest's
    filesystem: local host files, no workspace op, no event loop hop.

    Read-only is not a permission model, it is the guest's own build:
    letting a script edit the interpreter it is running inside would
    change what the next run executes. Mutations belong to the mounts,
    which is the other half.
