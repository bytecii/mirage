# The NUMBER half of GNU's `NUMBER[SUFFIX]`: finite non-negative decimals

# accepts "inf" and sleeps forever; an agent shell must never hang, so
# non-finite intervals are rejected (deliberate divergence). The regex also
# keeps Python/TypeScript parsing identical: float() alone would accept
# "inf", "nan", "1_0", and surrounding whitespace that Number() rejects, and
# Number() accepts hex that float() rejects.

# `apply_suffix` switches on one character, so exactly one may follow the
# number and the switch is lowercase only. Measured on coreutils 9.7:
# `sleep 0.005m` takes 0.3s, while `sleep 0S`, `sleep 0ss` and `sleep s`
# are all `invalid time interval`.
