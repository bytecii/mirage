# ambiguity rule (two matching words inside one entry are one value and
# match; two matching entries are two values and are ambiguous), and it
# is what `argmatch_valid_block` renders one `  - ` line per, which is
# how GNU answers `sort --check=x` with `  - 'quiet', 'silent'` on one
# line and `  - 'diagnose-first'` on the next.

    """gnulib's ``argmatch`` for one option value.

    The three answers of `argmatch (arg, arglist, vallist, valsize)`,
    in one pass, measured against coreutils 9.4:

    1. An EXACT word wins outright, even when it is a proper prefix of
       a longer candidate: `ls --quoting-style=shell` is `shell`, not an
       ambiguity with `shell-always`, and `ls --color=no` is `never`.
    2. Otherwise every word ``value`` is a prefix of matches. Plain byte
       prefix, case-sensitive (`ls --sort=NON` is invalid, neither
       ambiguous nor accepted), and a hyphen is an ordinary character
       (`--quoting-style=shell-a` resolves).
    3. Matching words are ACCEPTED when they all mean one value, and
       ambiguous only when they span two or more: `ls -l --time=a` hits
       `atime` and `access`, one value, exit 0, while `--time=c` hits
       `ctime` and `creation`, two values, exit 1.

    There is deliberately no empty-string branch, and adding one would
    be a bug. `""` is a prefix of every candidate, so it falls through
    rule 2 into rule 3 and is ambiguous exactly when the candidates span
    two or more values -- which is why `ls --sort=` and `wc --total=`
    answer `ambiguous argument ''` while a one-value set accepts it.
    gnulib does no such check either: its test is
    `strncmp (arglist[i], arg, 0) == 0`, true for every candidate.

    Args:
        value (str): the value as typed, never pre-escaped.
        choices (ArgmatchChoices): the candidates in declaration order,
            alias words of one value grouped into a tuple.

        ArgmatchResult: ``ArgmatchMatch`` carrying the canonical word,
            or ``ArgmatchRefusal`` carrying the wording GNU picks.
