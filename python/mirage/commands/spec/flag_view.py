    Commands receive flags as an untyped mapping from the dispatcher; this
    view is the one sanctioned way to read them, replacing ad-hoc
    `flags.get(...) is True` and isinstance chains.

    Args:
        flags (Mapping[str, FlagValue] | None): raw flag kwargs.
        spec (CommandSpec | None): when given, reads of names the spec does
            not declare raise KeyError. A missing key is otherwise
            indistinguishable from "flag not passed", so a typo in the name
            would silently read as False/None.
        occurrences (Sequence[tuple[str, str]]): the parser's
            per-occurrence value record, which the bag cannot hold;
            ``opts.value_occurrences`` is where a command reads it from.
            Empty is the honest answer for a view built without one, and
            only the two commands that ask for it supply one.

        accumulating option; a flag supplied
        by a default or the environment lands after every typed one.
        Names the line never carried are dropped. This is what an
        order-sensitive option family (grep's --include/--exclude,
        where the later kind overrides the earlier) reads, since the

        ``typed_order`` can only answer out of the bag, which keeps one

        (``nl -w abc -w 3`` refuses ``abc``, ``shuf -i 1-x -n abc``
        refuses the range) needs the occurrences the bag threw away.

        A view built without the record falls back to the bag, which is
        the same answer whenever no scalar dest was typed twice: each
        dest then sits at its own occurrence's position, in scan order.
        That is what the ~200 views constructed from a bag alone get,
