# Three of gh's types marshal themselves. "author" is its Author, which
# prints a user as {id, is_bot, login, name} and an actor with no id (a
# bot, whose login the query reads without one) as "app/<login>".
# "reactions" is its ReactionGroups, which drops every group nobody
# reacted with and prints [] rather than null. "owner" is its Owner,
# whose id and name are omitempty. OrNull is a pointer to any of them.
