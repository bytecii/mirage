    This is the async-to-sync boundary the whole design turns on. Every
    byte is fetched here, through the dispatcher; what comes back is an
    ordinary `BaseRepo`, so dulwich's own algorithms (the history
    walker, tree diff, three-way merge) run against a mount without ever
    learning that one exists. `BaseRepo` is the pluggable half of
    dulwich: `Repo` is the one that insists on a real filesystem.

    No working tree and no index are attached. Those are the parts
    dulwich hardwires to disk, and the parts mirage has to own.

    Objects come from the common directory and refs from both: a linked
    worktree shares the object database and the branches of the
    repository it was cut from, and owns only HEAD and whatever refs
    are per-checkout.

    Args:
        dispatch (DispatchFn): workspace op dispatcher.
        location (RepoLocation): the discovered repository.
