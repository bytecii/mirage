    """Discover and open the repository a verb was invoked against.

    Every verb starts the same way: honor ``-C``, walk up to the mount
    root looking for a ``.git``, then pull the object database across
    the dispatcher. Kept in one place so a new verb inherits the
    discovery rules rather than restating them, and so the refusal a
    verb owes outside a workspace is written once.

    The mount root comes from the name plane rather than a door of its
    own: ``ns.mounts.root_of`` is the same fact the command tier reads,
    and a second field holding the same callable is a second thing to
    keep in step.

    Args:
        fl (FlagView): the leaf's flag bag, read for ``-C``,
            ``--git-dir`` and ``--work-tree``.
        doors (CLIDoors): the invocation's doors, one per state plane.
        work_tree (bool): the verb reads or writes working files, so
            there must be a work tree to enter, as git's
            ``NEED_WORK_TREE`` asks.

    Raises:
        NoWorkspaceError: a plane this verb needs is not wired.
        NotAWorkTreeError: ``work_tree`` and there is none to enter.
