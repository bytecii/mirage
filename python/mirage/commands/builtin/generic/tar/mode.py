    """Whether a tar line reads the filesystem rather than an archive.

    Only ``-c`` makes tar's operands source paths. Under ``-t`` and
    ``-x`` they are member selectors matched against names inside the
    archive, so a selector that happens to spell a mount root is not a
    mount at all and refusing it would deny an ordinary listing.

    Scanned raw because both callers fire before flag parsing: the
    mount-root policy at admission, and the cross-mount router deciding
    whether a span is real. Only the first word may be GNU's dashless
    option cluster (``tar cf a.tar d``), so a later bare word is an
    operand and cannot turn the mode on. ``--`` ends the scan the way
    it ends GNU's option parsing: a later ``-c`` names a member, and
    reading it as the create flag would refuse the very selector fix
    this gate exists to protect (``tar -xf a.tar -C /dst -- -c``). A
    long word is read the way tar's getopt_long reads it, against tar's
    whole table, so an abbreviation (``--crea``) is create too.

    Args:
        argv (Sequence[str]): raw argv after the command name.
