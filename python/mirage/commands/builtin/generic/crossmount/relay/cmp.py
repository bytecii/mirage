    Pure wiring: both sides are read through dispatch-relayed primitives,
    and the flags go through the generic's own ``parse_flags`` -- reading
    them a second time here is how the relay came to take ``-i`` as a
    bare int while the generic had moved on to GNU's ``SKIP1:SKIP2``.

    Args:
        scopes (list[PathSpec]): The two path operands.
        flag_kwargs (dict): Flags parsed against the shared cmp spec.
        dispatch (DispatchFn): Workspace operation dispatcher.
        stdin (ByteSource | None): The line's input, which a ``-`` or
            ``/dev/stdin`` operand reads.
