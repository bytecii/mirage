    IsADirectoryError), a keyed store answers ENOENT because a directory
    there is a set of keys rather than an object, and sftp answers with
    an opaque non-OSError.

    Three ways the answer can be yes, in probe-cost order. The errno
    itself costs nothing. The stat is one call, and a stat that ANSWERS
    ends the cascade either way: a file is a file, and the later probe
    only makes sense for a path stat could not see. Reaching past a
    successful stat read a rule-refused file as a directory, because its

    through deeper keys.

    A no leaves the original error untouched, so nothing is swallowed:
    the caller re-raises what the backend said. Both probes are broad for
    that same reason: a probe that fails is a negative probe, never an
    error to surface. Surfacing one would replace the read's error with
    one from a call the user never made, and it is the read that failed.
    ``is_implicit_dir`` narrows to MISS_ERRORS because for its other
