    backend, so the gate would see the pattern, not the matches, and
    ``cat /scratch/*/k`` would pass a rule on ``/scratch/private``
    that ``cat /scratch/private/k`` fails. When a rule that reads
    paths (or a mount) applies to the command, whether it names the
    command or every command, the shell expands the glob first, so
    the gate judges the paths the command will touch.
