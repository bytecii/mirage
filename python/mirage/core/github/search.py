    The literal is sent verbatim, so the answer has to vouch for itself: an
    item is kept only when its ``repository.full_name`` names this
    repository (compared case-insensitively, as GitHub resolves ``repo:``),
    and the answer is complete only when ``incomplete_results`` is false and
    ``total_count`` is an integer no larger than the rows returned. A
    missing or malformed field counts against it, which costs a full scan and
    never a missed file.

        config (GitHubConfig): GitHub API config.
        owner (str): Repository owner.

    set also carries every file code search never indexes, which no answer
    can name; those come from the accessor's tree.

    Args:
        accessor (GitHubAccessor): backend handle: the repository, its
            recursive tree, and the session pool each search rides so it
            reuses the mount's connections instead of opening a session.
