class RateLimiter:
    """Spaces calls that share a key to at most ``rate`` per second.

    For an API that meters requests per second per resource and answers a
    burst with a penalty window rather than a queue (Airtable allows 5 per
    base, then refuses everything for 30 seconds), spacing the calls up
    front is cheaper than any retry. Each call reserves the next free slot
    for its key before it awaits anything, so concurrent callers queue in
    arrival order and the event loop needs no lock. Slots hold monotonic
    seconds, not loop handles, so one limiter serves every loop in the
    process.

    Args:
        rate (float): calls per second allowed per key.
        clock (Callable[[], float]): monotonic seconds, injectable for
            tests.
        sleep (Callable[[float], Awaitable[None]]): the wait, injectable for
            tests.
