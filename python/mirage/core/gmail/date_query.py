    """A Gmail date filter for a half-open range of UTC days.

    The bounds are epoch seconds rather than ``YYYY/MM/DD`` because
    Gmail reads a written date as "midnight on that date in the PST
    timezone" and names seconds as the way to mean any other zone, while
    a message lands in a day directory by its UTC ``internalDate``. The
    two disagree by the account's offset, so a written date would leave
    the first hours of the requested day outside the query and every
    message in them out of the listing. The lower bound is a second
    early because the operator's inclusivity at the exact second is not
    documented: an extra message from the day before is dropped by the
    bucketing, a missing one is not recoverable.

    Args:
        start (date): first UTC day, inclusive.
        end (date): last UTC day, exclusive.
