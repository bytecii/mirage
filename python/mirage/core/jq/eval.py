    one output that happens to be an array. `.a, .b` yields two values;
    `[.a, .b]` yields one.

    An error that no `try` catches ends the run, and jq still prints
    what came before it; `halt` and `halt_error` end the whole
    invocation. libjq's binding reports neither whole (an error that is
    not a string arrives as Python's rendering of it, and a halt as the
    plain end of the outputs), so the program runs inside a prelude that
    catches the error and hands it back as the run's last output, with a
    sentinel after the program that only a run that did not halt reaches
