    ``parents`` is accepted for the op signature and ignored, because
    ``create_dir`` is MKCOL over every missing level whatever it says.
    That is also why the ancestor invalidation is unconditional: a bare
    ``mkdir a/b/c`` materializes a whole chain here, and gating the walk
    on ``parents`` (as the backends whose mkdir really does create one
    level correctly do) left every ancestor above the parent serving a
    cached listing that hid the new levels until the index TTL expired.

    Args:
        accessor (NextcloudAccessor): Nextcloud accessor.
        path (PathSpec): collection to create.
        parents (bool): ignored; opendal always creates parents.
