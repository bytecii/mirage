    A pinned ``collection`` removes the leading collection segment, and

    ``.json`` row. A group slot decodes through ``PATH_SAFE``, so its
    filter holds the exact value the directory was rendered from; a
    ``basename_fields`` slot stays ``RAW`` because its rendering drops
    the value's parents and the lister resolves it against the payload
    instead.
