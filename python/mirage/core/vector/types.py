    """What the shared row tree asks of one vector store.

    The tree lists the store's tables (or pins one), adds one directory
    level per ``group_by`` column, and renders one file per row and
    suffix. The shared kit answers the catalog, stat, read dispatch and
    the ranked search; the store answers its own listing below a table,
    its readers, and how a ranked row spells its path and body.

    Args:
        vfs (str): the VFS name, which spells the group entries'
            resource type.
        detect (Callable[[A], DetectFn]): the mount's classifier.
        pinned (Callable[[A], str | None]): the table the config pins.
        search_limit (Callable[[A], int]): the default ``top_k``.
        list_tables (Callable[[A], Awaitable[list[str]]]): the catalog.
        table_exists (Callable[[A, str], Awaitable[bool]]): whether one
            table exists.
        children (Lister[A]): the entries under a table or a group.
        readers (Mapping[str, Reader[A]]): one reader per leaf kind.
        search_rows (Callable[[A, str, str, int], Awaitable[list[Row]]]):
            the ranked rows of a table for a query and a limit.
        rank_key (str): the row key the rank rides under.
        drops (Callable[[float, float], bool]): whether a rank falls short
            of a positive threshold.
        hit (Callable[[A, Row], tuple[list[str], bytes]]): a ranked row's
            path segments below its table, and its body.
