    """Map one local filesystem notification onto mount paths.

    Mirage runs no watcher of its own: the consumer owns the inotify /
    FSEvents / ReadDirectoryChangesW loop (watchdog, chokidar, or the
    raw syscall) and forwards what it saw, which keeps the dependency
    out of the package and lets a deployment pick its own mechanism.

    ``event_type`` is one of ``created``, ``modified``, ``deleted`` or
    ``moved``, so a consumer translates its library's spelling once
    (watchdog's ``created``/``modified``/``deleted``/``moved`` already
    match; chokidar's ``add``/``addDir`` are ``created``, ``unlink``/
    ``unlinkDir`` are ``deleted``, ``change`` is ``modified``). Any
    other name maps to nothing, because a watcher reports events this
    mount has no opinion about.

    ``payload`` carries the host absolute paths the event named:
    ``{"src_path": ..., "dest_path": ..., "is_directory": ...}``. Those
    are watchdog's own field names, taken verbatim from
    ``FileSystemEvent`` so a consumer can forward an event as a dict
    without renaming anything.
