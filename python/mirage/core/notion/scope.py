# A page tree nests arbitrarily, so the page level is one VARIADIC slot:
# `pages/a__1/b__2` is a page at any depth, and the slots hold the DEEPEST
# page's label and id, which is the one the path addresses. A database row
# is a page too, but one level of its own: the data source lists its rows
# as `rows.jsonl` rather than as directories, so a row is reached by its
# path alone and proves itself (`row` and `row_json`), while the pages
# under a row are listed by the row as any child page is.

# One description of the tree: readdir, stat and read all classify
# through it, so the file surface cannot disagree with itself about what
# a path means. The `page` and `page_json` kinds are declared twice, once
# per root, because a page behaves identically wherever it hangs.
