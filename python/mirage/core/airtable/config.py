            token), sent as ``Authorization: Bearer``.
        base_ids (list[str] | None): restrict the mount to these bases;
            None shows every base the token can reach.
        base_url (str): the API root, overridden to point at a fake.
        max_read_records (int): the most records one file may render. A
            table or view holding more is refused on a full read rather
            than paged at 5 requests a second for minutes; ``head`` still
            reads its first lines.
        requests_per_second (float): pacing per base. Airtable allows 5
            and answers a burst with a 30-second penalty.
