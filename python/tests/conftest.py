    A pooled session lives until its owner's ``close``, which unit tests

    the owner close chains have their own dedicated tests. The teardown
    runs after pytest-asyncio has torn the test's loop down, so
    ``asyncio.run`` opens a fresh one; that is safe because fixture
    teardown never executes under a running loop, and a transport-mocked
    session holds no live connections bound to the old loop.
