# `set_attr` is the *ungated* attribute door: it writes the record and
# asks no policy. That is correct only where this operand's own path
# already cleared `pre_session`, which is a per-call-site fact and not a
# property of the function it sits in. Reading a nearby `view.set` and
# assuming it covers the name at hand is how three separate bugs shipped:
# `readonly NAME` froze a refused name, `declare -x NAME` exported a
# host-seeded credential, and `SECRET=x cmd` handed one to the command.
#
# So every call site is written down here with the reason it is allowed.
# A new one fails this test until someone states which gated write covers
# it, or routes it through `view.mark` instead.
