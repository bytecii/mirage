    shape outright would mean 39 standing violations and a rule nobody
    could enforce.

    What the rule was reaching for is the nesting that buys nothing: a
    helper written inside a function although it reads only its own
    arguments. That one costs a rebuilt function object per call, hides a
    testable unit inside a scope no test can reach, and grows the body it
    sits in. Capture is the line between the two, and it is mechanical:
    either the def reads a name from the scope above it (or binds one
    through a parameter default), or it belongs at module level.
