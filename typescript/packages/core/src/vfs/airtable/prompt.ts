        table.json                 typed fields (with options) and views

        views/
          <view-name>__<view-id>.jsonl   records the view shows, in its order
  Always ls directories first to discover exact names: the name part of
  a segment is sanitized, the id after the LAST "__" is exact.

  A records.jsonl line is a mirage-normalized record:
    record_id, created_time, and fields (keyed by field NAME, values as
    Airtable returns them). Read table.json for each field's type.
  Airtable omits empty cells, so a missing key means empty (checkbox
  false included). A link field is a list of record ids; an attachment
  url expires two hours after it was read.
  records.jsonl lists in the API's own order; a view file applies the
  view's filter and sort. A file over max_read_records records is
  refused whole (File too large), while head -n N fetches just N records:
    head -n 20 {prefix}/bases/<base>/<table>/records.jsonl | jq .fields
  The airtable CLI, if installed, reaches what a file cannot: server-side
  filters (airtable record list --formula or --view), one record by id
  (airtable record get), and comments (airtable comment list).`

export const AIRTABLE_WRITE_PROMPT = `  Writes go through the airtable CLI if installed; a record line is the
