 * match; two matching entries are two values and are ambiguous), and it
 * is what `argmatchValidBlock` renders one `  - ` line per, which is how
 * GNU answers `sort --check=x` with `  - 'quiet', 'silent'` on one line
 * and `  - 'diagnose-first'` on the next.
 *

/**
 * gnulib's `argmatch` for one option value.
 *
 * The three answers of `argmatch (arg, arglist, vallist, valsize)`, in
 * one pass, measured against coreutils 9.4:
 *
 * 1. An EXACT word wins outright, even when it is a proper prefix of a
 *    longer candidate: `ls --quoting-style=shell` is `shell`, not an
 *    ambiguity with `shell-always`, and `ls --color=no` is `never`.
 * 2. Otherwise every word `value` is a prefix of matches. Plain byte
 *    prefix, case-sensitive (`ls --sort=NON` is invalid, neither
 *    ambiguous nor accepted), and a hyphen is an ordinary character
 *    (`--quoting-style=shell-a` resolves).
 * 3. Matching words are ACCEPTED when they all mean one value, and
 *    ambiguous only when they span two or more: `ls -l --time=a` hits
 *    `atime` and `access`, one value, exit 0, while `--time=c` hits
 *    `ctime` and `creation`, two values, exit 1.
 *
 * There is deliberately no empty-string branch, and adding one would be
 * a bug. `''` is a prefix of every candidate, so it falls through rule 2
 * into rule 3 and is ambiguous exactly when the candidates span two or
 * more values -- which is why `ls --sort=` and `wc --total=` answer
 * `ambiguous argument ''` while a one-value set accepts it. gnulib does
 * no such check either: its test is `strncmp (arglist[i], arg, 0) == 0`,
 * true for every candidate.
 *
 * `argmatch` in argmatch.py is the twin.
