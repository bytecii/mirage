 * per `groupBy` column, and renders one file per row and suffix. The shared
 * kit answers the catalog, stat, read dispatch and the ranked search; the
 * store answers its own listing below a table (`children`), its `readers`,
 * and how a ranked row spells its path and body (`hit`). `drops` says whether
 * a rank, read under `rankKey`, falls short of a positive threshold. Mirrors
 * `VectorTree` in `mirage/core/vector/types.py`.
