# integ

Cross-host integration tests: one declarative case corpus runs on the python
host and the typescript host against the same targets, so the two
implementations cannot drift apart.

## Pieces

- `runners/`: the battery. Every case is a shell line executed in a mirage
  workspace against a target's mounts; exit code, stdout and stderr are
  compared across hosts and against pinned goldens.
- `targets.json`: the targets, their mounts, and the env vars each service
  needs.
- `server/`: the fake services. The kit fakes (github, slack, box, dropbox,
  onedrive, gws, mail, gcs, ...) store per run in SQLite through `server/kit/`;
  `server/launcher/main.ts` hosts all of them in one process, one pinned port
  each from `ci/fakes.json`, and announces one `NAME_URL=...` line per arm.
  Each fake has a selftest: `pnpm run <name>:selftest`.
- `prisma/`: one schema per kit fake.
- `fixtures/`: the seed data cases assume.

## Runs and tenants

A run is an isolated world; a tenant is an account inside it. The runner mints
a fresh run id per target, so parallel batteries against one launcher never
collide.

- HTTP fakes carry the run as a `/_run/<id>/` path prefix, stripped before
  routing; the tenant comes from the credential.
- The mail fake speaks IMAP and SMTP, where no path exists: the username's
  local part is the tenant and the password is the run, so two runs log in at
  one address and see different mail.
- Kit storage is one SQLite file per run under a per-process temp root;
  `POST /reset` seeds or recreates one run.

For unmodified vendor clients that only accept a base URL and credential, opt
into credential routing on the fake process:

```sh
MIRAGE_RUN_TOKEN_PATTERN='^draw:(?<run>[^:]+):(?<tenant>[^:]+)$' \
  pnpm run notion:server
```

Seed with `POST /reset {"run":"a","tenants":["ws"],"fixture":"v1"}`,
then use `Authorization: Bearer draw:a:ws` with the ordinary vendor base URL.
The pattern's named `run` capture is required; `tenant` is optional and keeps
an account/namespace independent of its run. `Authorization: token ...` is
also accepted for run selection. Embedders can set `KitConfig.runTokenPattern`
instead of the environment variable. Without a matching pattern, existing
routing is unchanged. Precedence is path, run header, run query, credential;
explicit tenant headers/queries take precedence over the credential tenant.
Captured names use the same validation as explicit selectors.

GWS accepts the credential in the OAuth `refresh_token` form field and returns
it as the access token, so the subsequent bearer selects the same run. HF Hub
REST and MCP share run routing and request scheduling.

`DELETE /_kit/runs/<run>` waits for that run's requests, disconnects its client,
deletes its SQLite files and forgets its clocks, counters and remembered
fixture. It is idempotent; a later reset can reuse the name. Other runs are
unaffected. A bare reset remembers the last successful fixture **for that
run**; a new or deleted run starts from the process's `--fixture` choice.
`GET /_kit/health` reports `runs` as a count, never run identifiers.

Stores the fakes do not own are namespaced per run by the runner's adapters
and torn down after: S3 buckets `mirage-integ-<run>-...` (moto in-process by
default), a Mongo database `mirage_integ_<run>`, redis key prefixes, and temp
dirs for ssh.

## Running locally

The `unix/cp` and `unix/mv` cases use GNU coreutils 9.7 as their transfer
reference (`debian:stable-slim`, `LC_ALL=C LANG=C TZ=UTC`). In particular,
`--update` accepts and advertises `all`, `none`, `none-fail`, and `older`;
the three-candidate diagnostic from 9.4 is no longer the reference.
The remeasurement used image
`debian@sha256:04634311a8d5fc442b6eb06d792293c4f3e2268652ca7634e00ce8ef5cc0a28a`.
One existing environment difference remains: for a missing exchange target,
this image reports `Unknown error -1`; the `mv_exchange_missing_side` golden
retains `No such file or directory`.

```bash
cd integ && npx tsx server/launcher/main.ts --config ci/fakes.json
# export the NAME_URL lines it prints, then:
./python/.venv/bin/python integ/runners/python/main.py --facet core --strict \
  --allow-skip chroma,lancedb,nextcloud,notion,postgres,qdrant
```

The core facet also needs redis and mongo on their default ports (CI uses a
`mongo:8` service container; `docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo:8` matches
it) and `MIRAGE_QUICKJS_HOME` pointing at the quickjs-ng WASI build for the
scripted target. If a pinned port is taken locally, copy `ci/fakes.json` and
move that one entry.
