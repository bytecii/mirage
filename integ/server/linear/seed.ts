// Two facts the fixture states only implicitly, resolved once per seeded
// tenant rather than on every read.
//
// The issue number is the identifier's trailing digits (PLAT-2 -> 2, and 0
// for anything that does not end in -<digits>), which is what issueCreate
// counts up from. The generic seeder cannot derive it, because it is a
// function of another column.
//
// The label list arrives as a scalar array on the issue, which the seeder
// JSON-stringifies into Issue.labelIds. Expanding it here into IssueLabel
// rows and clearing the column leaves the link table as the only place a
// label membership lives, so a read never has to decide which of the two to
// believe.
//
// Issue.seq is renumbered across teams into one global ordinal, because the
// old fake held every issue in one insertion-ordered dict and IssueSearch
// pages out of it. The seeder can only count within a team's nested list.
