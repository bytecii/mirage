// generated Prisma `WhereUniqueInput` for a compound @@id is a REQUIRED
// property, not an index signature, so a fixed Record return does not overlap
// with it at all and a point lookup would have to be written
// `as unknown as Prisma.XWhereUniqueInput` -- a double cast, which is exactly
// the spelling that stops reporting a wrong key name. The type argument is
// passed explicitly (`idWhere<Prisma.CardWhereUniqueInput>(...)`), because a
// contextual type does not reach here through Prisma's own generic
// findUnique/delete call. tenantWhere usually needs no argument: a
